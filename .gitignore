# --- Project-specific generated files ---
# Note: We do NOT ignore the project output folders like '03_translation_workspace/'
# or '.cache/' here. This is intentional. The 'example_project' should be
# fully version-controlled so new users can see how it works.
#
# If you create your own translation projects inside this repository for testing,
# you are responsible for not committing their output.
