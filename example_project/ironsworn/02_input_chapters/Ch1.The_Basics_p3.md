# HARM

**Harm** represents physical damage and fatigue. You inflict harm on your foes in combat, and you *Endure Harm* when you are attacked or fail to overcome a physical hazard or ordeal.

## INFLICTING HARM

When you successfully attack a foe using the *Strike* (page 79) or *Clash* (page 80) moves, you inflict harm. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm. You may have an option to inflict additional harm through the choices you make in a move.

Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe's progress track, as appropriate to their rank. For example, each point of harm equals 2 ticks when fighting an extreme enemy, or 2 full progress boxes when fighting a dangerous enemy.

## ENDURING HARM

When you face physical injury or hardship, make the *Endure Harm* move (page 91). As part of that move, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm suffered. There are five ranks of harm.

- **Troublesome (1 harm):** An attack by a minor foe, a painful injury, or a tiring effort.
- **Dangerous (2 harm):** An attack by a skilled foe or deadly creature, a nasty injury, or a demanding effort.
- **Formidable (3 harm):** An attack by an exceptional foe or mighty creature, a serious injury, or an exhausting effort.
- **Extreme (4 harm):** An overwhelming attack by a monster or beast, a grievous injury, or a debilitating effort.
- **Epic (5 harm):** An attack by a legendary foe of mythic power, a horrific injury, or a consuming effort.

When you are fighting a foe, they inflict harm based on their rank. Sample foes are in chapter 5 (page 133).

If you are at 0 health, a miss on the *Endure Harm* move puts you at risk of suffering a debility or dying. You can recover health through rest and recuperation, using moves such as *Heal* (page 63), *Make Camp* (page 64), and *Sojourn* (page 71).

# STRESS

**Stress** represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face mental shock or despair, make the *Endure Stress* move (page 95). As part of that move, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. There are five ranks of stress.

- **Troublesome (1 stress):** An unsettling incident or frustrating failure.
- **Dangerous (2 stress):** A distressing incident or upsetting failure.
- **Formidable (3 stress):** A horrifying incident or demoralizing failure.
- **Extreme (4 stress):** A heart-rending incident or traumatic failure.
- **Epic (5 stress):** A soul-shattering incident or the loss of all hope.

When you are opposing a foe, they can inflict stress (such as a terrifying visage or demoralizing taunt) based on their rank. Sample foes are in chapter 5 (page 133).

When you *Endure Stress*, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. If you are at 0 spirit, you are in danger of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

You can recover spirit by relaxing when you *Make Camp* (page 64), finding fellowship when you *Sojourn* (page 71), or when you *Forge a Bond* (page 74).

Unlike harm, you do not inflict stress on others—at least not mechanically. If you attempt to frighten or demoralize another character, make an appropriate move to see what happens.

# ASSETS

**Assets** are a key component of your character. They give you additional options and bonuses when making a move, and may include their own special moves. When you create your character (page 31), you select your starting assets. When you *Fulfill Your Vow* and gain experience (page 44), you can *Advance* to spend your experience on new assets or upgrade current assets.

To learn more about assets, see page 39.

> **You can mix-and-match assets however you like. There are no designated assets based on character classes or roles. However, you should avoid picking the same asset as another player.**

*[Asset Card Example with annotations:]*

**PATH**
**SLAYER**

● When you *Gather Information* by tracking a beast or horror, or when you *Secure an Advantage* by readying yourself for a fight against them, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

○ When you *Swear an Iron Vow* to slay a beast or horror, you may reroll any dice. When you *Fulfill Your Vow* and mark experience, take +1 experience.

○ When you slay a beast or horror (at least formidable), you may take a trophy and choose one.
- Power a ritual: When you or an ally make a ritual move, reroll any dice (one time only).
- Prove your worth: When you *Sojourn*, reroll any dice (one time only).

*[Annotations around the asset card:]*
- **This is the asset type.** When you pick an asset, you choose from **companions**, **paths**, **combat talents**, and **rituals**.
- **Most assets include a default ability, represented by the filled-in circle.** If it doesn't have a starting ability, you get to pick one.
- **Assets usually modify moves by giving you a bonus or allow you to use the move in a different way.** Some assets include their own unique moves.
- **As you gain experience, you can purchase upgrades for your assets.** When you purchase an upgrade, you fill in the circle to show that you now have that ability.

# ORACLES

Some moves may prompt you to roll on a table to generate a result between 1 and 100. There are also a set of creative prompts in chapter 6 (page 165), which you can use to reveal details, trigger events, and guide the actions of other characters in your world. These **oracles** help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide inspiration for the GM in guided play.

## ROLLING ORACLE DICE

Whenever you are prompted by a move or an oracle table to generate a result between 1 and 100, roll two ten-sided dice.

*[Dice illustrations showing two methods:]*
1. **80** and **3** - One of your oracle dice may include tens digits on its faces. If so, you'd read this result as 83.
2. **3** and **6** - You can also use two D10s of different colors, and decide before rolling which represents the tens digit and which is the units. You'd read this result as 36.

> **You might want to use a special set of dice for your oracle rolls, shared by everyone at the table. It'll make those dice feel special and unique.**

*[Image: Black and white landscape photograph showing a lone bare tree on a snowy hillside with dark stormy clouds overhead and silhouettes of ravens or crows flying in the sky, creating an ominous atmosphere typical of the Ironlands setting.]*

## SEEKING ANSWERS

If you are playing solo or co-op, you can *Ask the Oracle* to help guide your game session and trigger ideas when you need to know what happens next. Its most basic function is to answer a "yes" or "no" question. Combined with your own instincts and creativity, this move—and other random prompts—can push your story in surprising and exciting directions. To learn more about this move, see page 107.

**ASK THE ORACLE**

When you seek to resolve questions, discover details in the world, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events, you may…

- **Draw a conclusion:** Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
- **Ask a yes/no question:** Decide the odds of a 'yes', and roll on the table below to check the answer.
- **Pick two:** Envision two options. Rate one as 'likely', and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.
- **Spark an idea:** Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

*[Oracle Table:]*
| Odds | The answer is 'yes' if you roll... |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| Almost Certain | 11 or greater |
| Likely | 26 or greater |
| 50/50 | 51 or greater |
| Unlikely | 76 or greater |
| Small Chance | 91 or greater |

*[Annotation: "Roll on this table using your oracle dice to generate a result between 1 and 100"]*

On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.

If you are playing with a GM, they are the oracle. When you see a prompt to *Ask the Oracle*, turn to your GM. The GM is free to leverage random tools and creative prompts to come up with the answers.

Keep in mind that—even when playing with a GM—Ironsworn is about shared storytelling. Offer suggestions. Talk it out. The GM is the final arbiter of what happens next, but everyone at the table should participate in building the world and creating the narrative of your game.

---

## MORE RANDOMNESS

You'll find a set of random tables in chapter 6 (page 165). These provide inspirational prompts and random results for common situations. You can also use whatever random generators you prefer, including those drawn from another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards.

## TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

These random generators will never replace your own imagination and intuition. If it's interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it happen. Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about "what happens next" can kill the momentum of your game or make it feel disconnected and incoherent.

Keep it moving. Ask a question. If an answer leaps to mind, go with it. If you're not sure, *Ask the Oracle*. Then, play.

---

# BONDS

As you explore your world and complete quests, you create bonds with people and communities by making the *Forge a Bond* move (page 74). Bonds give you advantages for specific moves when interacting with those you have bonded with. For example, if you attempt to *Compel* someone (page 69), and you share a bond with them, you add +1 to your action score. The moves tell you when having a bond provides this advantage.

Bonds also help determine your fate when you retire from your life as an adventurer. The more bonds you create, the more connections you have with people and communities, the better your chance to live out your days peacefully in the company of others.

Your character sheet has a special progress track for bonds. When you successfully *Forge a Bond*, mark 1 tick on this progress track. When your adventures are complete and you *Write Your Epilogue* (page 77), tally your bonds and make a progress roll (page 18) to wrap up your character's story.

---

# OTHER CHARACTERS

The mechanics of Ironsworn are almost entirely character-facing—meaning they reference the capabilities and actions of your character. Other non-player characters and creatures (**NPCs**) don't have mechanical detail. In fact, they may only have a single stat—their rank—for tracking progress against them in a combat scene. Further, NPCs do not make moves. You won't roll dice for them to determine the outcome of their actions. When you attempt to influence them, oppose them, resist them, or aid them, make moves as your character. If you have questions about an NPC's motivations or what they do next, *Ask the Oracle*. To learn more, see page 133.

## ALLIES AND COMPANIONS

If you are playing a co-op or guided game with other players, their characters are referred to in these rules and in moves as your **allies**.

A **companion** is a special type of asset. Unlike normal NPCs, they can provide mechanical benefits through their abilities, and they have a health track to record harm. If the text of a move refers to a companion, it means a companion asset. To learn more about companions, see page 39.

---

# EQUIPMENT

In Ironsworn, you won't worry too much about equipment. Your supply track (page 34) is an abstract representation of your general readiness, clothes, ammo, food, water, and mundane gear.

You are armed and armored as appropriate to your vision for your character. If you wield a weapon, you can inflict harm with it. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm.

Other equipment provides narrative benefit. It enables you to make moves where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid a move altogether.

> **For example, you need to make your way down a steep rock face. Without assistance, you'd make a *Face Danger* move to see what happens. If you had rope, the climb is not particularly risky or uncertain. In that case, you might skip the move and just narrate the result.**

Specific assets (page 39) can make equipment more important and relevant to your character. For example, combat talent assets (page 40) represent your expertise in a particular weapon or fighting style. When you wield an appropriate weapon, you gain the benefit of the asset.

Apart from assets, you can make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like, but don't fuss over it. If you're wondering whether you have a particular mundane item, you can *Ask the Oracle* (page 107).

# THE FLOW OF PLAY

Like most roleplaying games, you play primarily from the perspective of your character. What are you doing? What are you trying to achieve? What opposition and challenges do you face? Your quests, and the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the choices you make.

When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in your world respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels right (if you're playing solo or co-op), or ask your GM. When you are seeking inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate, you make the *Ask the Oracle* move (page 107). Use the yes/no questions and random prompts to generate interesting twists and new complications you might not have thought of on your own. Above all, if it's interesting, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen.

If you are doing something covered by a move, refer to the move to resolve your action. If it tells you to roll dice, do it.

Scoring a strong hit on a move means you are in control. You're driving the narrative. What do you do next?

A weak hit or a miss means you don't have control of the situation. Instead of acting, you react. What happens next? If you're playing with a GM, they'll determine how the world responds. Otherwise, you rely on your intuition and occasional oracle rolls to drive the narrative.

*[Image: Black and white photograph of a woman in fur-trimmed clothing holding a bow and arrow, standing on rocky terrain with a dramatic landscape behind her, embodying the adventurous spirit of an Ironsworn character.]*

# WHAT'S NEXT

That's the basics of playing Ironsworn. You'll see these concepts referenced and expanded throughout this rulebook, but it's not necessary to read or understand it all before playing. To get started:

**1** **Create your character** (page 31). Set your stats, select your assets, and consider your background and personality.

**2** **Build your world** (page 111). Take a tour of the Ironlands, create your unique vision of the setting, and find inspirational prompts for vows and quests. Or, start playing in your own world.

**3** **Review the moves** (page 49). It'll be helpful to get a basic understanding of the moves and how you resolve your character's actions and intent. You can start by printing out the move reference sheets, available at ironswornrpg.com. Then, refer to chapter 3 when you have a question or want further detail.

**4** **Review the example of play** (page 241). See Ironsworn in action to help understand the basic die roll mechanics, how to interpret moves and outcomes, and how to use creative prompts to drive your story forward.

**5** ***Swear an Iron Vow*** (page 98). Play to see what happens. When you have questions about moves, see page 49. When you need a foe or encounter, see page 133. When you seek answers from an oracle, see page 165.

**6** **Dig deeper** (page 193). When you're ready to explore campaign setup guides, additional gameplay options, and best practices, see chapter 7.

*[Narrative Text on dark stone texture background:]*

*The mother asked the seer to divine her new baby's fate. The old mystic came and looked at the sleeping child. She tilted her head, closed her eyes. Then, she drew back, frowning. No need to ask the gods. No need to roll the stones.*

*"Ironsworn," the seer said.*

*She took her price in silver and blood, and left the mother alone with the baby.*

*That night, the mother wept, for she knew her child would grow to live apart from her. Whether consumed by duty or vengeance, wanderlust or love, it was all the same. The trackless wilds would call, the blade and shadow would whisper their secrets, and her child would leave.*

*She cried for the life her child would live, and she cried for the knowing of it.*
