# MOMENTUM

**Momentum** is a special mechanic which is central to playing Ironsworn. Your momentum value ranges from a -6 to +10 and represents how you are faring in your quests. Move results may tell you to increase or decrease momentum.

The **momentum track** is on the left side of your character sheet. You can use a paper clip or token to mark the current value.

When you have **positive momentum**, things are going your way. You have the advantage. You are in control. Your path is clear. You are properly positioned for success.

When you have **negative momentum**, the tide has turned against you. You face tough odds. You are outmatched. Your next steps are uncertain.

> **Momentum persists through scenes and between gaming sessions. When you finish a session, write down your current momentum value. Then, pick up where you left off when you return to the game.**

## GAINING MOMENTUM

You gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. If a move tells you to add momentum (phrased as "take +X momentum"), increase your momentum track by the value indicated. The choices you make in a move, or the assets you use to support the move, may modify the amount rewarded.

In general, taking +1 momentum represents a minor advantage. Taking +2 momentum (or more) represents a major advantage.

## LOSING MOMENTUM

You can lose momentum as a choice when making moves, or as an outcome of a move—particularly on a weak hit or miss. If a move tells you to suffer a specific loss of momentum (phrased as "suffer -X momentum"), you reduce your momentum track by the value indicated. The options you choose in a move, or the assets you leverage, may alter this penalty.

If you lose momentum as a result of a narrative outcome without a defined value, such as when you make the *Pay the Price* move (page 105), you should suffer a reduction appropriate to the narrative circumstances.

- For a **minor disadvantage or complication**, suffer -1 momentum.
- For a **major disadvantage or complication**, suffer -2 momentum.

Some moves and assets give you the option to suffer a loss of momentum in exchange for temporary advantages. If you take this option, adjust your momentum track by the amount indicated.

## BURNING MOMENTUM

**Burning momentum** is a powerful option to build on your success and deliver a decisive result or avoid dire failure. When you have positive momentum, after you roll your move, you may cancel any challenge dice that are less than your current momentum value. This gives you an automatic hit.

If both challenge dice are less than your momentum value, you may cancel them both for a strong hit. If you burn momentum when only one of the challenge dice is less than your momentum value, the result of the other die stands—giving you a weak hit.

For example, your momentum track is at +6 and your action score is 4. You roll a 5 and an 8 on your challenge dice. You may burn momentum to cancel the 5, but not the 8. This shifts your result from a miss to a weak hit.

*[Diagram showing:]*
```
MOMENTUM TRACK: +8, +7, +6 (circled), +5, +4
CHALLENGE DICE: 5 (with "You may cancel this die" annotation), 8
```

Burning momentum is never required. Even if you score a miss on a move and have enough momentum to cancel the challenge dice, you can choose to suffer the failure and save your momentum for a more crucial moment.

After you burn momentum, you must **reset your momentum**. See the next page for how that works.

---

## RESETTING MOMENTUM

After you burn momentum, you must adjust your momentum track to your **momentum reset** value. The default reset is +2. This value may be lowered when your character suffers from a **debility** (page 36). Debilities are conditions such as wounded, shaken, or unprepared. They are marked on your character sheet as a result of a move or a narrative event.

- If you have **one debility marked**, your momentum reset is +1.
- If you have **more than one debility marked**, your momentum reset is 0.

There is a box below the momentum track where you can record your current momentum reset.

## SUFFERING NEGATIVE MOMENTUM

When your momentum is less than 0, and it matches the value of your action die, you must cancel your action die. You still check the success of your move by comparing your stat plus your adds to the challenge dice, but you won't have your action die to help you.

*[Diagram showing:]*
```
MOMENTUM TRACK: -2, -3, -4 (circled), -5
ACTION DIE: 4 (crossed out with "You must cancel this die")
CONDITIONS: WOUNDED checkbox
```

## MINIMUM MOMENTUM

Your momentum cannot drop lower than -6. This is your **minimum momentum**. If a move tells you to lower your momentum, and your momentum is already at its minimum, you will instead make the *Face a Setback* move (page 97). As a result of this move, you reduce your health, spirit, or supply (or some combination thereof) by that amount, or undermine your progress in a current quest, journey, or fight.

Make moves such as *Secure an Advantage* (page 61) to increase your momentum.

---

## MAX MOMENTUM

Your **max momentum** starts at +10, and is reduced by 1 for every marked debility. There's a spot on your character sheet to record this value. You can't increase momentum over your max. If you are at your max and a move gives you an option to increase your momentum, you can't take that benefit.

---

# PROGRESS TRACKS

A **progress track** is used to measure your pace and determine the outcome of a goal or challenge in specific situations.

- When you *Swear an Iron Vow* (page 98), a progress track represents the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal.
- When you *Undertake a Journey* (page 65), a progress track represents how far you've gone and how favorable the travel has been.
- When you *Enter the Fray* (page 78), a progress track represents your advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in combat.
- When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world and *Forge a Bond* (page 74), you mark your bond on a progress track.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes which you fill in—or **mark**—as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

```
□□□□□□□□□□
```

Since making progress on your quests may stretch over many sessions, your character sheet includes progress tracks for vows. Your character sheet also includes a progress track for your bonds. For journeys and fights, you can sketch out your progress tracks on whatever is convenient, or use the challenge worksheets provided at ironswornrpg.com.

## CHALLENGE RANKS

When you engage in a fight, initiate a journey, or swear a vow, you give your challenge a **rank**. In increasing order of difficulty, the ranks are **troublesome**, **dangerous**, **formidable**, **extreme**, and **epic**. You (or the GM) will choose a rank appropriate to the situation and how quickly or easily it should be resolved. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. A typical challenge is dangerous or formidable. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome. Guidelines for foes are on page 134, and for journeys on page 111. Give your vows a rank appropriate to the complexity of your quest and the amount of emphasis you want to give the vow in your story.

## MARKING PROGRESS

You will perform specific moves to advance toward your goal. For example, as you travel across perilous lands, you *Undertake a Journey* and **mark progress** when you successfully reach waypoints in your travel.

> **UNDERTAKE A JOURNEY**
> 
> When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands, first determine the rank of your journey (*Ask the Oracle* if unsure).
> 
> - Troublesome journey: 3 progress per waypoint.
> - Dangerous journey: 2 progress per waypoint.
> - Formidable journey: 1 progress per waypoint.
> - Extreme journey: 2 ticks per waypoint.
> - Epic journey: 1 tick per waypoint.
> 
> Then, for each segment of your journey, roll +wits. If you are setting off from a community with which you share a bond, add +1 to your initial roll.
> 
> On a strong hit, you reach a waypoint. If the waypoint is unknown to you, envision it (*Ask the Oracle* if unsure). Then, choose one.
> - You make good use of your resources: Mark progress.
> - You move at speed: Mark progress and take +1 momentum, but suffer -1 supply.
> 
> On a weak hit, you reach a waypoint and mark progress, but suffer -1 supply.
> 
> On a miss, you are waylaid by a perilous event. *Pay the Price*.

*[Annotation: "This move lets you mark progress on a strong or weak hit."]*

Similarly, when you fight, you *Strike* (page 79) or *Clash* (page 80) to inflict harm on your foe. To move forward in your quest, you use the *Reach a Milestone* move (page 100). These incremental moves let you amass advantages to have the best chance of success when you are ready to resolve your challenge.

Whenever you successfully move toward your goal, you partially or fully fill in a box on your progress track. You fill progress boxes with lines—called **ticks**. A full progress box consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When a move tells you to mark progress, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or progress boxes based on the rank of your challenge.

*[Progress marking diagram showing:]*

- **Troublesome** - mark 3 progress (3 fully filled star boxes)
- **Dangerous** - mark 2 progress (2 fully filled star boxes)
- **Formidable** - mark 1 progress (1 fully filled star box)
- **Extreme** - mark 2 ticks (half a star box)
- **Epic** - mark 1 tick (quarter of a star box)

## MARKING PROGRESS FOR BONDS

If you are marking progress on your bonds progress track, you always mark 1 tick unless a move tells you otherwise. Bonds are not given a challenge rank. To learn more about bonds, see page 24.

# PROGRESS MOVES

There are four moves, called **progress moves**, which utilize progress tracks to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge.

- To resolve a quest, *Fulfill Your Vow* (page 101).
- To end your journey, *Reach Your Destination* (page 68).
- To decide the outcome of combat, *End the Fight* (page 82).
- When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, *Write Your Epilogue* (page 77).

> **REACH YOUR DESTINATION**
> 
> *Progress Move*
> 
> When your journey comes to an end, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.
> 
> On a strong hit, the situation at your destination favors you. Choose one.
> - Make another move now and add +1.
> - Take +1 momentum.
> 
> On a weak hit, you arrive but face an unforeseen hazard or complication. Envision what you find (*Ask the Oracle* if unsure).
> 
> On a miss, you have gone hopelessly astray, your objective is lost to you, or you were misled about your destination. If your journey continues, clear all but one filled progress, and raise the journey's rank by one (if not already epic).

*[Annotations:]*
- "This label identifies this move as a progress move."
- "A progress move uses a progress roll instead of an action roll (see the next page for how it works)."

## PROGRESS ROLLS

You don't make an action roll when you make a progress move. Instead, you tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This is your **progress score**. Then, roll your challenge dice and compare your progress score to the value of the dice.

As with an action roll, if your progress score is greater than both challenge dice, it's a strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it's a weak hit. If you fail to beat either die, it's a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve the challenge based on the outcome of your roll. Also, keep an eye out for a match, which represents a surprising twist or unusual complication.

In the example below, you would compare your +6 progress score to your challenge dice when making your progress move. The seventh progress box is only partially filled in, and won't count toward the progress score.

*[Progress track diagram showing:]*
```
PROGRESS SCORE: 6

[6 fully filled star boxes][1 partially filled box][3 empty boxes]

CHALLENGE DICE: 4 ✓, 6 ✗
```

When deciding whether to make your progress move, you need to weigh your chance of success against the risk of continuing to make preparatory moves. One thing to remember: It's not necessary to fill your progress track before making your progress move. In fact, a weak hit or miss on a progress roll can lead to exciting new story possibilities.

## MOMENTUM AND PROGRESS ROLLS

Momentum is ignored when you make a progress move. You cannot burn momentum on a progress roll, and you do not suffer from negative momentum.

## SHARING PROGRESS TRACKS WITH ALLIES

When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, a journey, or a fight—you share a progress track and mark progress together. When you make a progress move, only one of you rolls the dice. The result will stand for the group.
