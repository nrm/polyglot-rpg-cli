## PLAYING IRONSWORN

In the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game, you are a hero sworn to undertake perilous quests in the dark fantasy setting of the Ironlands. You will explore untracked wilds, fight desperate battles, forge bonds with isolated communities, and reveal the secrets of this harsh land. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

To play Ironsworn, you create your character, make some decisions about the world you inhabit, and set the story in motion. When you encounter something dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome.

Ironsworn supports three modes of play.

- **Guided:** One or more players take the role of their characters, the protagonists in your story, while a gamemaster (GM) moderates the session. The GM helps bring the world to life, portrays the people and creatures you encounter, and makes decisions about the outcome of your actions.

- **Cooperative (Co-Op):** You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A GM is not required. The Ironsworn game system will help you explore the dramatic stories of your characters and their fateful vows.

- **Solo:** As with cooperative play, no GM is necessary. You portray a lone heroic character in a dangerous world. Good luck!

> **Ironsworn is primarily intended for solo and small group play. One to four players (plus a GM in guided mode) is ideal. The characters portrayed by other players are referred to in these rules as your allies.**

## WHAT YOU NEED

If you're playing solo, just grab some materials and get started. A session can be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours.

If you're playing with one or more friends—either guided or co-op—you probably want to dedicate enough time to make some progress in your quests. Plan on a couple of hours or more.

Make sure you have:

- Two ten-sided dice (d10) for each player. These are your **challenge dice**.
- One six-sided die (d6) for each player. This is your **action die**.
- Optionally, another pair of ten-sided dice to use as your **oracle dice**.
- A printed **character sheet** for each player and printed **asset cards** (available at ironswornrpg.com).
- Some counters for marking status tracks on your character sheet. You can use paper clips, beads, dice, coins, tokens from other games, or whatever is convenient.

> **Not required, but helpful: Printed reference sheets for moves, the blank Ironlands map, and other worksheets available at ironswornrpg.com.**

## MECHANICS AND THE FICTION

Ironsworn uses various **mechanics**, such as rolling dice and managing the stats and resources on your character sheet. As a player, you will often make decisions based on a desired mechanical outcome. For example, you might choose a particular action to get a bonus on your die roll. The basic mechanics of Ironsworn are introduced in this chapter.

Ironsworn is also heavily reliant on **the fiction**, which is the imagined characters, situations, and places within your game. You will play from the perspective of your character. You will interpret actions and events in a way that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality you have forged for your story and your world.

To learn more about how the mechanics and fiction interact, see page 203.

## THE SETTING

The default setting for your adventures is the **Ironlands**. It is a rugged peninsula of isolated communities and untracked wilds on the frontier of the known world. You can learn more about the setting starting on page 111. For now, here's a summary of some default assumptions.

- Two generations ago, your people were driven to the Ironlands from their former homes in the Old World.
- The weather here is harsh. Winters are brutal. The rugged terrain makes travel and trade difficult and dangerous.
- There are no thriving cities. Instead, Ironlanders live in isolated villages or steadings. Their homes are modest buildings of wood, stone, and thatch.
- Many areas of the Ironlands are unexplored and uninhabited except by the firstborn—beings such as elves, giants, and the wolf-like varou.
- Coins have little value here. Most commerce is made through barter and favors
- Some communities remain isolated and independent, while others trade in basic goods such as iron, grain, wood, livestock, wool, and coal.
- There is a diverse mix of peoples and cultures within the Ironlands, even within a single community. You can envision your character and those you interact with however you like, unbound by considerations of geography, lineage, sexual orientation, and gender.
- Communities sometimes band together under a powerful leader, but there are no kingdoms. Territorial lines are sketchily drawn, if at all.
- Large-scale warfare is unheard of, but raiding parties and skirmishes between communities are a constant menace. Some communities subsist entirely on raiding.
- Spear, axe, shield, and bow are the dominant weapons. Swords are rare and highly prized. Some warriors choose to wade into battle clad in iron, while others trust in their prowess or in the strength of their shields.
- Magic is subtle and mysterious. Mystics seek to ward away the darkness through the practice of magic, but often succumb to it. Rituals are performed as blessings and to gain insight.
- Supernatural creatures and beasts are rare, frightening, and dangerous.

You are encouraged to make Ironsworn your own, and to bend the setting to your liking. Your version of the Ironlands will be unique because you'll define aspects such as the history of your people, magic, mythic beasts, and more. The choices you make will help inspire the personal vows driving your character.

You can also ignore the Ironlands entirely and play in your own world, or explore a setting inspired by media, history, or another roleplaying game. The Ironsworn rules are flexible enough to accommodate many forms of gritty fantasy or historical fiction.

With a bit of work, you can even adapt these rules to different genres. See page 237 for more on hacking Ironsworn.

## IRON VOWS

In the Ironlands, a **vow** is sacred. When you declare your solemn promise to serve or aid someone, or to complete a personal quest, your honor is bound to that vow. Abandoning or recanting an oath is the worst sort of failure.

When you swear a vow, you touch a piece of iron. It can be an iron coin, a weapon, or your armor. It's an old tradition. Some say the iron, a piece of the primal world, serves as a conduit to the old gods—so they may better hear your promise.

Vows are the core of playing Ironsworn. It is your vows that drive you. These goals create the context for your adventures and challenges. As you complete vows, you gain experience and new abilities.

When you create your character, you start with a **background vow**. When you setup your campaign, you envision or encounter an **inciting incident** which triggers a new vow. There are several prompts for vows associated with the details of the world in chapter 4 (page 111), and with foes and encounters in chapter 5 (page 133). You can select something which fits your vision for the world and your character's goals, or just come up with something yourself. If you are playing in co-op mode, you and your fellow players may have shared vows and personal vows.

To learn more about your first vows and starting your campaign, see page 193.

## YOUR CHARACTER

You use your **character sheet** to track your stats, overall condition, and progress in your quests. You also have **assets** (page 21), which are abilities you choose when you create your character and when you gain experience. These components help you determine the outcome when things get dangerous or uncertain.

However, your character is more than these mechanical bits. You are the protagonist in a rich story. You have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. You have a history. You are, or were, part of a community. This is the fiction of your character. Consider a few of these details as you create your character, but don't sweat it. You'll evolve it through play. At the start of your game, put your character on stage to see what happens. Fill in the blanks—for your character and your world—as you go.

To learn more about creating your character and the components that make up your character, see page 31.

*[Diagram: Annotated character sheet breakdown showing the relationships between different character elements:]

**Your vows** (page 35) are your sacred oaths to complete perilous quests. Each vow has a rank and is managed through a progress track.

**You have five stats** (page 33) which represent the core aspects of your character. These are often added as a bonus when you take action.

**As you fulfill vows, you earn experience** (page 44). You spend experience to gain new assets.

**As you take action, you build or lose momentum** (page 11). Positive momentum can help improve the result of an action. Negative momentum can undermine an otherwise successful action.

**You suffer debilities** (page 36) as you face harrowing challenges. Some debilities are temporary and easily mended; others are permanent.

**You have status tracks for health, spirit, and supply** (page 33). These represent your current condition and readiness.

## MOVES

**Moves** are self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or question. There is a move for most common situations you encounter in Ironsworn. They have specific **triggers**, phrased as "When you [blank]." When your character does that thing, or you encounter that situation, refer to the move to see what happens.

Moves are organized by activities.

- **Adventure moves** (page 60) cover a variety of dangers, conducting investigations, traveling, making camp, and healing.
- **Relationship moves** (page 69) involve persuading others to do something, building bonds with people and communities, resting and recuperating within a community, aiding your allies, and initiating duels.
- **Combat moves** (page 78) are used when fighting (but not exclusively; other moves may come into play as well).
- **Suffer moves** (page 90) occur when you endure hardship, such as suffering physical harm or facing a dispiriting challenge.
- **Quest moves** (page 98) encompass iron vows, making progress in a sworn quest, and improving your character.
- **Fate moves** (page 104) help you decide what happens in solo and co-op play, or support the GM's decisions and brainstorming in guided play.

When a move's name is referenced within these rules or by another move, you'll see it as *italicized text*.

Most moves are based on risky actions you are taking. You are attacking with your sword, making a dangerous climb, or healing an ally. These moves use dice to determine the outcome. This is called an **action roll** (page 8).

Some moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such as a journey or fight, using a **progress track** (page 14). When you are ready to resolve the challenge, you make a **progress roll** (page 18).

Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an **oracle roll** (page 22). These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out of your character's control. If you're playing solo or co-op, you can use the *Ask the Oracle* move (page 107) to answer questions about the world, resolve how other characters respond, or determine what happens next.

Some moves don't require a roll. They might support or reference a separate move, or simply help you resolve a mechanical or narrative situation. Don't roll dice unless a move tells you to. To learn more about moves, see page 49.

*[Example Move Layout with annotations showing the structure:]

**GATHER INFORMATION**

When you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation, or follow a track, roll +wits. If you act within a community or ask questions of a person with whom you share a bond, add +1.

On a strong hit, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn (*Ask the Oracle* if unsure), and take +2 momentum.

On a weak hit, the information complicates your quest or introduces a new danger. Envision what you discover (*Ask the Oracle* if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. *Pay the Price*.

*[Annotations around the move example:]*
- **This is the move's name.**
- **This is the move's trigger.** When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move.
- **Moves which require an action roll will tell you which stat to add to your roll, and may give you an option to include other bonuses (called adds).**
- **Moves with an action roll include three levels of possible results: A strong hit, a weak hit, and a miss.**
- **When a move is referenced within another move, you'll see it as italicized text.**

## THE ACTION ROLL

When you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, you roll three dice at once.

- **Challenge dice:** Two ten-sided dice (D10)
- **Action die:** A six-sided die (D6)

*[Dice illustration showing:]*
- Two d10s showing 4 and 8 labeled "CHALLENGE DICE"
- One d6 showing 3 labeled "ACTION DIE"

Add your relevant stat to your action die. The move will tell you which stat to add, or may give you a choice. Some moves will tell you to use one of your tracks, such as health or supply, in place of a stat. Based on the move or your character's assets, you may also have an opportunity to apply one or more bonuses called **adds**. The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your **action score**. Your action score is never greater than 10—anything over that is ignored.

*[Calculation example showing:]*
ACTION DIE (3) + STAT (2) + ADDS (1) = ACTION SCORE (6)

To determine the outcome of your move, compare the action score to each of the challenge dice. You want it to be greater than the individual value of those dice.

*[Comparison diagram showing:]*
ACTION SCORE (6) COMPARE TO CHALLENGE DICE (4 ✓ Greater than, 8 ✗ NOT greater than)

There are three possible results for a move.

**Strong Hit** ✓✓
Your action score is greater than both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.

**Weak Hit** ✓✗
Your action score is greater than only one of the challenge dice. You probably succeeded, but with a lesser effect or cost.

**Miss** ✗✗
Your action score isn't greater than either of the challenge dice. You failed, or need to make some serious concessions.

The move will tell you how to interpret the outcome of your action, or offer a choice. The result may include mechanical changes to your character's status and narrative changes to the current situation.

When you score a miss on a move, you'll usually see a prompt to *Pay the Price*. This is a special move that lets you pick a likely negative outcome or roll to see what happens. If you're playing with a GM, they may consult with this move, or just tell you the price.

The main thing to remember on a miss: Something always happens. The situation gets more complex, dramatic, or dangerous. To learn more about the *Pay the Price* move, see page 105.

> **Ties always go to the challenge dice. Your action score needs to exceed—not equal—the challenge dice to count as a hit.**

## MATCHES

*[Dice illustration showing two d10s both showing 5, with "=" between them]*

When you roll for a move, you should be on the lookout for a **match** on the challenge dice. In cooperative and solo play, this is your trigger to add a twist, create a new complication, or otherwise mix things up. Something interesting, unexpected, or unusual happens. If you're unsure, you *Ask the Oracle*, which is a move you use to ask questions or check for inspiration. If you're playing with a GM, a match on the challenge dice can be their prompt to introduce a surprising turn of events.

The outcome of a match should be evaluated based on the result of your move.

- **Strong hit:** The match should represent a twist in the narrative, something interesting, or a new opportunity.
- **Miss:** The match should represent a heightened negative outcome, a complication, or new danger. Things get worse for you in an unexpected way.

You can also let the intensity of your success or failure frame how you interpret a match. Rolling matched 10's on your challenge dice should prompt you to introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure. It's as bad as things get.

## GM'S AND THE DICE

If you are playing as a GM, you can focus on guiding the game and responding to your player's questions and actions. Since NPCs don't make moves, you won't need to make action rolls. However, you might want to have a pair of D10's available for oracle rolls (page 22).
